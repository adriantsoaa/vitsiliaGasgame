                    The framework of the game is a rectangle, subdivided into
                    6 squares aligned two by two. Here, two groups of the same
                    number face each other. One of them is designated as "boka"
                    (literally leper) or "hawk" whose role is to capture the rest
                    of the team who are trying at all costs to enter and then exit
                    the frame without being hit by "the hawk". The latter while
                    remaining on the line delimiting the frame, tries to touch
                    those who want to enter or leave.

                <p class = "exp2">
                    The two groups of "Vitsilia" are the image of two opposing
                    camps. A spirit of struggle and activism is therefore instilled.
                    This attempt to enter or leave a protected area reflects a desire
                    to overcome obstacles.
